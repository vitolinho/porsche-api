## Set up locally

Before you dive in, make sure to set up your environment variables by following these steps:

1. Clone the project: Open your terminal and clone our project repository by running the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/vitolinho/porsche-api.git`

2. **Grab the `.env.example`**: Head over to your project directory and find the `.env.example` file. This serves as a template for your environment variables.

3. **Fill in the `.env` file**: Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Open it up and fill in the required values based on your setup. Don't worry, the example file provides hints on what each variable should be set to.

4. **Ready to Launch!**: Once your `.env` file is properly filled, you're almost ready to go!

5. **Start Docker**: If you haven't already, make sure you have Docker installed. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven't already.

6. **Run the command**: In your terminal, simply execute `make up` or `docker-compose up -d --build` to start up your local environment.
